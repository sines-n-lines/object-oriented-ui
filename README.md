# object-oriented-ui

A simple, object based library of UI elements for use in Processing projects, designed by Jordan Accinelli (@sines_n_lines).
Designed as an alternative to the current GUI kits available in the Processing Libraries, this project aims to simplify the implementation of UI elements which add interactivity to projects made by the masses. I have personally found that it is impossible to work with the current systems, and am striving to create and optimise a system based of off OOP.
